# Module 11 Challenge - Express Note Taker

## Description

This application is my solution to the Module 11 Challenge of the Coding Bootcamp.
This application allows users to enter custom notes. After creation, users can select a specific note from a list, and view more information regarding the note.
This project allowed me to sharpen my skills in Express, and improved my understanding of how backend routes and requests work.

2. View Github page of raw JavaScript code using the link below:
